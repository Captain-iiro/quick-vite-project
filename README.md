Handling Changes
All the reusable components are organized in the /src/components directory. If you need to update something, such as the navbar, edit the component files in this folder. To modify the styles, navigate to /src/scss where youâ€™ll find Sass partials for variables, mixins, and base styles.

Hot reloading is enabled by Vite, meaning any changes you make will automatically refresh in the browser, providing immediate feedback on your updates.
