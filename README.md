# Vite Sass Starter
This is a quick-start project setup with Vite and Sass to help you get started with modern JavaScript development. Ideal for rapid prototyping or experimenting with new web effects.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdouDev22/quick-vite-project.git
   cd quick-vite-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Handling Changes
All the reusable components are organized in the /src/components directory. If you need to update something, such as the navbar, edit the component files in this folder. To modify the styles, navigate to /src/scss where youâ€™ll find Sass partials for variables, mixins, and base styles.

Hot reloading is enabled by Vite, meaning any changes you make will automatically refresh in the browser, providing immediate feedback on your updates.
